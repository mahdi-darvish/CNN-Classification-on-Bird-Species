# Comparative Analysis of ConvNet Architecture on Bird Species Dataset

This is an implementation of famous convolutional neural networks on Bird species dataset using Python 3, Keras, and Tensorflow. I trained these models and compared their results, and discussed how a model architecture can help the model success on specific data.
